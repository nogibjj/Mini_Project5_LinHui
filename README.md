# Python SQLite Database Interaction

This script demonstrates how to interact with an SQLite database using Python's sqlite3 module. It performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and executes additional SQL queries on a table within the provided SQLite database.

## Features

1. Connect to the SQLite database.
2. CRUD Operations:
    - Create: Add a new record.
    - Read: Fetch records.
    - Update: Modify an existing record.
    - Delete: Remove a record.
3. Execute two additional SQL queries:
    - Fetch the total number of records.
    - Fetch records based on a condition.

## Requirements

1. Python
2. SQLite database (AAPL.db)

## Log

After executing the script, a log of the database operations is saved in database_operations.log. This log provides evidence of the successful execution of the database operations.
